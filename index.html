								<h3>ROS based Digital Twin Framework for Collaboration Robot</h3>
								<h6><a href="https://triknight.github.io">Tri Bien Minh*, </a> Phu Do, Hung Q. Nguyen, Khang H. V. Nguyen, Thao T.T Phan - Proceedings of the International Conference on Sustainable Energy Technologies</h6>	
								<p>
									This paper presents a real-time machine health monitoring digital twin (DT) framework for robot machine-tending applications based on ISO 23247. The framework utilizes OPC UA for communication and ROS for data exchange between components. It consists of a physical space with robotic hardware and a cyberspace DT layer with three main entities for data collection, edge computing, and user interaction.

								<h3>Position-based Visual Servoing with Dual Manipulators</h3>
								<h6><a href="https://triknight.github.io">Tri Bien Minh*</a> </h6>	
								<p>
									The research focuses on designing a system for position-based visual servoing (PBVS) with dual 6-Degree of Freedom (DoF) UR10e robots. The main robot uses computer vision integrated position-based servoing algorithm for tracking the ARTag trajectories from another robot by using
									Realsense D435 camera. The result of this algorithm is joint velocity control on the real UR10e
									robot, which helps the main robot simultaneously track the ARTag trajectories in real time.

								<h3>Robot Gesture Control Using Online Feedback Data with Multi-Tracking Capture System.</h3>

							<p>This study uses a Vicon system, a high-speed accurate marker-based motion capture system aiming to develop a wireless low-latency gesture control method that requires no hardware development and no on-board power source. A novel control is designed to track a rigid-body object’s motion in the work- space and translate it to robot control signals. The system has five main compo- nents: a host PC with a Vicon software named Tracker, a set of eight Vicon Van- tage V8 infrared cameras, a client PC that receives Tracker’s broadcasted data over the Ethernet, a robot model named youBot provided by KUKA, and a rigid- body object that will act as the gesture controller.

								<p>The study shows the new platform of the V-frame octocopter kinematics analysis, designed on the CAD software, with some important mechanical parts using FEM analysis to find the highest stress and displacement under high load applied, the result of all connecting the joints 3D printing part is completely safe. Mechanical parts were manufactured by using 3D printing technology and CNC milling. Moreover, the study has shown V-frame octocopter simulation based on Simulink using the second method Ziegler- Nichols to find suitable parameters of the PID controller for roll and pitch angle. Using the block simulation is good for implementing and fast checking the new algorithm when building the new platform of the robot.

								<h3>Adaptive Optimal Control for Upper Exoskeleton following Saturation Function </h3>
								<h6>Do Xuan Phu, <a href="https://triknight.github.io">Tri Bien Minh</a>- 24th International Conference on Mechatronics Technology (ICMT), 2021, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9687228">DOI: 10.1109/ICMT53429.2021.9687228</a>.</h6>	
								 <p>In this study, a new optimal control based on saturation function for the upper exoskeleton is presented. The saturation model is an advanced model including signum function property, which is symbolized by the sliding mode model. Input control of the system is then designed following the saturation model. The gain of the input control is obtained following adaptation law related to the dynamic parameter of the system. After formulating, the control is simulated for evaluation. The random movement of the upper exoskeleton is applied in the simulation, and the tracking performance is used for the proposed controller. The simulation results show that the proposed control is good performance and can be applied in the real system.
